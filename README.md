# Minimum Common Web Platform API polyfill

üéÅ A bundled polyfill for the [Minimum Common Web Platform API]

üìã Use `structuredClone()` everywhere \
üåê Call `fetch()` with no fear \
üñ•Ô∏è Works in [Node.js] \
ü¶ï Works in [Deno] \
üßÖ Works in [Bun]

## Installation

![npm](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=npm&color=CB3837&logo=npm&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![Yarn](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Yarn&color=2C8EBB&logo=Yarn&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![pnpm](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=pnpm&color=222222&logo=pnpm&logoColor=F69220&label=)

You can install this locally using npm, [Yarn], or [pnpm]:

```sh
npm install @jcbhmr/common-min-api
```

You can use this package with Node.js, Deno, or Bun to fill in their own gaps in
the [Minimum Common Web Platform API]. Make sure you're using a relatively
modern version of your runtime so that you can use the least amount of polyfill
code!

‚öñÔ∏è Don't worry! Each sub-polyfill uses an `if`-gated `import()` so you only pay
for what wasn't already implemented in your environment.

## Usage

![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Node.js&color=339933&logo=Node.js&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![Deno](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Deno&color=000000&logo=Deno&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![Bun](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Bun&color=000000&logo=Bun&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

```js
import "@jcbhmr/common-min-api";

const b = structuredClone({ n: 1 });
console.log(b.n);
//=> 1
setTimeout(() => reportError(new Error("üåã Oh no!")), 1000);
const r = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(10));
console.info(r);
//=> Uint8Array(10)¬†[...]
const f = new File(["foo"], "foo.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
const u = new URL("https://example.com/foo");
if (new URLPattern("https://example.com/*").test(u)) {
  const response = await fetch(u);
  const text = await response.text();
  console.log(text);
}
```

üë¥ This polyfill bundle is **not** intended for _ancient_ environments like
IE 11. The purpose of this polyfill bundle is to make it easier to write
isomorphic modern code that uses popular web platform APIs that may not exist on
certain platforms yet.

to use:

This package is literally just a bunch of `import` statements. ü§£ You can test
Node.js compatibility by running `npm test`. You'll need to manually check for
Deno and Bun compatibility.

```sh
npm test
```

Regarding versioning: Each child polyfill package should be **pinned** to a
specific version. On patch updates, release a patch update of this package. On
minor updates, release a minor update of this package. On major updates, release
a major update of this package. This is to ensure that the polyfill bundle is
stable and predictable, while also letting `^` and `~` ranges work as expected.

Oh, and we also use **bundleDependencies** to make sure that the you only need
to fetch _this_ package to get all of the dependencies. This is to make it
faster to download.
